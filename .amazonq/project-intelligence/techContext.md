## Development Environment Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v14.x or later
- npm v6.14.4 or later
- git v2.14.1 or later
- AWS account with appropriate permissions

### Local Development

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies with `npm i`
3. Configure AWS credentials for Amplify
4. Deploy sandbox environment with `npm run sandbox`
5. Start local development server with `npm run dev`

### Environment Variables

- `APH_ENV`: Controls environment-specific configurations (e.g., `sandbox`)

## Project Structure

### Key Directories

- `/app`: Next.js App Router pages and layouts
- `/components`: React components organized by feature
- `/lib`: Utility functions, server actions, and data models
- `/amplify`: AWS Amplify configuration and backend resources
- `/__tests__`: Test files mirroring the source directory structure

### Code Organization

- **Feature-based**: Components and functionality organized by feature area
- **Clear separation**: UI components, server actions, and data models kept separate
- **Consistent naming**: PascalCase for components, kebab-case for files

## Data Models and Schema

### Prompt Schema

```typescript
// Simplified representation
interface Prompt {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  content: string;
  tags: string[];
  owner: string;
  ownerName: string;
  copyCount: number;
  downloadCount: number;
  createdAt: string;
  updatedAt: string;
}
```

### Project Rule Schema

```typescript
// Simplified representation
interface ProjectRule {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  content: string;
  tags: string[];
  owner: string;
  ownerName: string;
  copyCount: number;
  downloadCount: number;
  createdAt: string;
  updatedAt: string;
}
```

### User Schema

```typescript
// Simplified representation
interface User {
  id: string;
  email: string;
  name: string;
  createdAt: string;
  updatedAt: string;
}
```

## API and Data Flow

### GraphQL API

- AppSync provides GraphQL API for data operations
- Custom JavaScript resolvers handle business logic
- Authentication and authorization integrated with Cognito

### Server Actions

- Next.js server actions handle form submissions and data mutations
- Actions communicate with AppSync for data operations
- Zod schemas validate input data

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing

- Jest for component and utility function testing
- React Testing Library for component interaction testing
- Tests located in `/__tests__` directory mirroring source structure

### End-to-End Testing

- Playwright for browser-based end-to-end testing
- Tests cover critical user flows like authentication, prompt creation, and search

## Deployment and CI/CD

### Environments

- Development: Local development environment
- Sandbox: Isolated testing environment with simplified configuration
- Production: Live environment with full configuration

### CI/CD Pipeline

- GitHub Actions for continuous integration
- Automated testing on pull requests
- Deployment to AWS Amplify hosting

## Technical Constraints

### AWS Integration

- Must use AWS services for backend functionality
- Must follow AWS best practices for security and scalability

### Performance Requirements

- Fast page loads and interactions
- Efficient search functionality
- Responsive design for all device sizes

### Security Requirements

- Secure authentication with Cognito
- Data validation on both client and server
- Protection against common web vulnerabilities

## Dependencies and Third-Party Services

### Core Dependencies

- AWS Amplify for backend services
- Next.js for frontend framework
- Shadcn UI and Tailwind for UI components

### Development Dependencies

- Testing frameworks (Jest, Playwright)
- Code quality tools (ESLint, Prettier)
- Build tools (TypeScript, SWC)
