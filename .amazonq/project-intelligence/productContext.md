# History

Akkodis Prompt Hub was forked from the Promptz project (https://github.com/cremich/promptz) written by Christian Bonzelet @ AWS, originally designed for Q Developer.
Akkodis have expanded this to include prompts and rulesets for other AI tooling to aid adoption and consistency throughout the organisation.
